# git_test

this is just a test class to handle two time formats. I just wantto see how this works.

ultimately, i'm used to running my own scripts from the script itself using -  if __name__ == “__main__”:


Question 1: re README.md.  What do you mean that this file can be formatted? I see no formatting options. 

Question 2: After __init__ gets called this is where you'd put class variables, right?  is there anything else that typically goes here?

Question 3: So as long as this code is saved in the same folder with another .py document that will be running it all you have to do
is use the file name.class name.method name to use it, right?  ie import TimeFix.timefix.time_text.
