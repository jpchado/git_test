# git_test

this is just a test class to handle two time formats. I just wantto see how this works.

ultimately, i'm used to running my own scripts from the script itself using -  if __name__ == “__main__”:


Question 1: re README.md.  What do you mean that this file can be formatted? I see no formatting options. 

Question 2: After "__init__" gets called this is where you'd put class variables, right?  is there anything else that typically goes here?

Question 3: So as long as timefix_run is saved in the same folder with TimeFix.py all you have to do
is use the file name.class name.method name to use it, right?  

ie: import TimeFix.timefix.time_text 

and the use it. "n = TimeFix.timefix.time_text('0745')"   or am i going about this all wrong?
